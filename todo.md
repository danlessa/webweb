# client:
- "play" frames
    - frames can have a "duration" attribute
        - specifies how many miliseconds or something a frame lasts
        - then fire an event every time
- edge scaling:
    - scale strength/length with weight of edge
- add network- and layer-level display settings
    - eg:
        - network.networkname.display.w = 100
        - network.networkname.layers[0].display.w = 100
- BUG:
    - weight zero are scaled to zero even when scaleLink is off
